Create menu options for the user
Request the response from user as a integer 
Request the user to input a number between 0 and the max in string form 
If that string is equal to "q", calls recursive to main()
If that string is not equal to "q", it will convert from a string into integer
Enter while statement as long as the integer is not equal to the machine picked integer
    return information on if the guessed digit is correct
        int guess is too low
        int guess is too high 
    If user enters "q", it will recursive call main()
        menu for 3 options come up 
If user inputs 2 
    Return message requesting a new max number that has to be a positive integer
        print 
            Integer has been changed
            Or that number is out of bounce
                recursive call Main()
if user inputs 3
    program ends
    print 
        good bye
